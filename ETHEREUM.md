# Ethereum

Ethereum is a  **decentralized platform** that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

These apps run on a custom built  **blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property**. 

This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.
